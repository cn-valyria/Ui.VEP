              <h3>Manage your own balance instead of individual deals</h3>
              <p>
                If you've played CN before, you're probably familiar with the concept of a "tech deal": a buyer sends 
                cash to a seller in exchange for technology. They can be great for new players and ancient nations 
                alike, but they typically require a lot of research, maintenance, and tracking in order to maintain 
                healthy deals long-term.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Valyrian Exchange Program is a new paradigm in tech dealing. Instead of managing individual deals, 
                you are given a simple ledger - known as your balance - that tracks how much aid you've sent, how much 
                you're owed, and how much you're due to send. VEP enrolls well over one hundred nations, with an even 
                split of buyers and sellers, so you're guaranteed a consistent source of incoming aid and outgoing 
                targets. Never worry about 1x1 deals again; get signed up in VEP today!

                    Let's be honest: CN isn't known for being a very attractive app. It doesn't have to be that 
                    way for a wonderful tool such as VEP, though! And VEP isn't just pretty; it is thoughtfully-
                    crafted to be simple and easy to understand.

                    In VEP, it's assumed that if you have an open aid slot, then you'd like to either receive aid or 
                    send more out. We want to make sure that you're using your aid slots to their max capacity!
